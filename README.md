## 🧠 2. Select – Key Evidence of My Development

### 📌 Network Design Project: Enhancing Hospital Infrastructure

**Project Description**  
Designed a secure and redundant network for Jones Hospital using Cisco Packet Tracer. The project emphasized high availability, department segmentation using VLANs, and backup configurations.

**Key Features:**
- Three-tier architecture (core, distribution, access)
- VLAN segmentation (e.g., Admin, Doctors, Labs)
- Firewalls, ACLs, and switch port security
- Redundant links and disaster recovery simulation
- Backup solution integration using VEEAM

**Tools Used:**
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- MS PowerPoint
- Draw.io (for diagrams)
